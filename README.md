# Containers Respawn Patcher
Allows you to make a patch for your entire modlist to make all containers respawnable, in a safe way regarding Player Homes.
There is a built-in system to make containers NOT respawn inside player homes, configurable in the settings.

You do not need this if you have WACCF!

Settings:
-list of containers to replace with "respawnable" variants. Only these containers will be made respawnable. By default, containers from the base game and DLCs are included.
-list of cell EditorIDs where all containers will be replaced with "NoRespawn" variants. By default, only Skyrim and DLCs player homes are included.
-debug: leave it off. It just enables some output lines for myself.
